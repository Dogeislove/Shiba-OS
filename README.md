IMPORTANT: PLZ INSTALL VISUAL STUDIOS FOR DIS TO WORK 
FOR NEW SNAPSHOTS GO TO THE PRE-RELESAE BRANCH. SHIBA OS 0.6 IS NOT OUT YET AND IS REQUIRES TESTING. YOU CAN TEST OUT 0.6 EARLY!
have you ever wanted a whole os dedicated to a dog? Do you hate puppy 
linux because there is no shibas? Well this is kind of for you. A very simple os that is more like command prompt but i coded it. 
Its rly bad but anyways, i tried to make a shibe os. For years, the doges wanted to see a doge os. Well now they can (sort of). 
I update like every 6 hours if not, its prob cause i got something to do.This is a early build of shiba-os
Please note i'm new to c++ so there are alot of bad-coding
